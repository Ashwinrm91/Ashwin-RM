Cucumber BDD Framework --- Restappured API Automation

Features of Framework:

The framework is created in such a way where feature line in the feature file is mapped to the Java methods.

This framework can be understandable even by a non-technical person. This can be extended to UI automation, Fetch DB data, and providing excellent reports.

Each feature file is annotated with Cucumber tags we run whichever test we want just by placing the tag in runner class
